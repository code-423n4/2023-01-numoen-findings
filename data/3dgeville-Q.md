Issue:

Not using OpenZeppelin contracts. Instead of using a battle tested library the dev team has reimplemented some feathers that could have been found in the OpenZeppelin library. This increases the amount of code that the dev  team will have to maintain and misses all the improvements and bug fixes that the OpenZeppelin team is constantly implementing with the help of the community. I recommend the dev team to use OpenZeppelin.

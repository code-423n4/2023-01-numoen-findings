Pair.sol, lines 53 - 67:

invariant can leave the pool in an where it has more liquidity that it has recorded. When a + b > c + d, protocol expects the arbitrageurs to come and take the liquidity away, or call the `mint`function in `lendgine` to add the liquidity without paying anything until a + b = c + d. Protocol can avoid finishing up in states with a + b > c + d where they introduce clear arbitrage opportunities and can easily return the remaining amount to the owner.

lengine.sol, lines 95-100:

Protocol can return the extra amount of collateral to the user, whereby currently it would be locked in contract if sent more than collateral value.

lengine.sol, lines 71 and 105:

The namings of `mint` and `burn` function can become less ambiguous by remaining to `mintPowerToken` and `burnPowerToken`.

lengine.sol, line 72:

`mint` should check for address(0) for to.

Pair.sol, line 93:

Can check for the liquidity to be not more than totalLiquidity to throw a meaningful error. This is already checked in the lengine mint funciton, but would be helpful for future updates.

Pair.sol, line 116:

check for underflow to return a meaningful message incase underflow happens.

 Lengine.sol:

The errors are not compatible with the actual reason, e.g. lengine.sol line 112 should not be an input error

Lengine.sol:

`dilutionLPRequested` can be rounded down to zero while the timestamp is updated. there is also loss of precision in the jumprate formula while calculating `util`
